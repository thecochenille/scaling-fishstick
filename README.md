# Project Motivation
As in many products that require a subscription plan, being able to predict which customers are likely to downgrade or cancel their subscriptions can allow companies to develop personalized communication and marketing strategies and ultimately avoid revenue loss by improving customer retention. Churn prediction leveraged data on how a customer uses a service (usage and behavior) and machine learning models to identify users at risk to churn.
